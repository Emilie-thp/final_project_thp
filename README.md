"Oeil de Biche Production" is a beautiful website designed for a real association established in the French-Jura region whose mission is to highlight the biodiversity richness of the region through documentary, blog and photo production. For a complete experience on our website, we suggest to do two different pathways, for visitors and account administrators (association members only).

-----

* Visitors' pathway:

Click this link to start: *https://oeil-de-biche.herokuapp.com/*

Visitors land on a home page where they have a preview-access to unique the association’s information, photos, projects (Réalisations) sorted by categories, events, and a blog (Articles) section. As well as a contact form for ask questions and have fast replies.

Through the navigation bar visitors can access the association profil: Who we are, our missions, our equipment, etc..
Also they access to projects link where they will find all the projects created by the association members.
A complete access to the events organized by the association, same for blog (Articles) pages, which is available through the navbar.

However only administratons can create, edit or delete PROJECTS and ARTICLES.

If they want to get in touch with administrators, visitors can complete and send a CONTACT form. The administrator webmaster will receive a warning email to let them know.

-----

* Administrators' pathway

*https://oeil-de-biche.herokuapp.com/admins/sign_up*

After completing a sign-in or a sign up form, administrators land on the website’s home page where they will find a “espace admin” button linking to a dashboard page where they will find a side bar with all the projects, articles, events, categories and messages sent by visitors through the contact form. Admins are allow to create, edit (add photos, save modifications, add categories to projects, etc...) and delete only the objects they created on their own, they can only have a view-access to the others members work. 
A very nice feature, allow admins to put online or offline their work, saving the work done ,in case of pair-review of the content. In other words when the content is complete and corrected an admin can click on “mettre en ligne” to show it on the home page.

First time siging up, they receive a welcome email and if they need a new password.

Administrators can change their profile: nickname, profile photo, give a description and expertise. They  can decide if they want to show their profile on the home page. They can also change their mail and password on “mon compte” link on the side bar.

Administrators can also go back to home for a check out the online content page and sign out from their session.
